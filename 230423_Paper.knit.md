    This paper provides evidence of the effects of geography on economic development using a natural experiment. In 1825, a storm caused the Agger Isthmus in northwestern Denmark to flood and form a shallow channel, which gradually deepened and became navigable by 1834. This enabled large ships to access an otherwise isolated region. The timing of the storm was random and the formation of the channel was unexpected, making it a useful natural experiment. Trade data from the Sound Toll Registry is used to show that after 1834 trade to the region increased dramatically. Using census across multiple decades and a difference-in-difference approach, it is demonstrated that this triggered a process of adaptation that eventually led to a 24 percent increase in population size. A key concern in any study of infrastructure is wheter it causes intrinsic growth or just reallocate it from elsewhere. Using new occupational data together with age, gender and birthplace information it is shown that the channel provided new economic opportunities and fertility drove the observed increase in population. That is, the growth was mainly intrinsic. Concerns over generalizability and external validity of this result is addressed using a panel of archaeological findings and the occurrence of a similar but reverse natural experiment 700 years prior, when a channel closed in the same location. The general insight is the same: Natural endowments of trade-enabling infrastructure determine the location of prosperity.

# 1. Introduction
In the broadest sense, there are two types of long-run explanations for why some places prosper while others struggle: institutions [@rodrik2004institutions] and geography [@Henderson2018satelite]. A predominant consensus suggests that institutions play a primary role, with geography exerting its influence through its impact on the formation of institutions [@Acemoglu2001; @rodrik2004institutions; @Easterly2003; @Ketterer2018]. This paper demonstrates the importance of favorable geography in its own right with the caveat, that adaptation to the geographic opportunities is key in unlocking the benefits. This is demonstrated at the local level using a natural experiment.

In 1825 a violent storm breached the Agger Isthmus. An erosion process was initiated and in 1834 a navigable channel had formed. The isthmus had previously separated the Limfjord from the North Sea. But now the region was endowed with convenient access to the open ocean and world markets (see Figure \ref{fig:main_map}). Market towns of the western Limfjord had previously been small and isolated. Now they grew to become important ports of international trade. Similarly, between 1085 and 1208 a similar channel closed. After the last ice age, Northwestern Denmark was left with a convenient westward channel, used by traders and Viking fleets alike. In the 1100s this channel closed due to gradual land-rises - an ongoing process since the last ice age [@Christensen2004]. What followed was a long-run stagnation of the Western Limfjord region until the geographic circumstances was reversed in 1834.

The effect of the 1825 breach came in three waves. First of all the breach caused a change in the salinity of the Limfjord waters. This led to the extinction of many important species of fish, but the channel also enabled open ocean fishing, which would outgrow previous fishing within the Limfjord waters. Secondly, the channel boosted trade. Before 1834 there was practically no trade directly to the region - and very little indirectly. This changed suddenly afterwards. Third, the channel was the onset of a process of secondary infrastructure construction and institutional adaptation. E.g. ports, alternative waterways, but also independent trading rights for West Limfjord market towns. The growth accelerated only as this picked up. 

This paper shows quantitative evidence for these effects by relying on the channel formation as an exogenous shock in a difference in difference approach. This is done using historical census data, a large database of Northern European historical trade (the Sound Toll Register) and the density of archaeological findings. It is shown that the 1825 breach led to an increase in population of 24 percent in 1901. To document the mechanisms, I have collected new data on all Danish occupations in the period 1787-1901. The Danish censuses contain a description of each person's occupation. A new machine learning procedure is applied to these descriptions to convert them into standardized HISCO codes [@2023HISCO]. The HISCO-coded census data is then used to estimate the effect on occupational structure. The key finding is that the channel caused both fishing and manufacturing to grow. Using age, gender and birthplace information it is shown that the population growth came primarily from fertility - not migration. This addresses a key concern in the study of infrastructure. Does infrastructure cause intrinsic growth or just reallocate it? Denmark of the 19th century was in a post-Malthusian regime, where growth causes fertility [@Jensen2022]. As such, the evidence of this paper suggests that intrinsic growth is the most likely explanation of the observed effect. 

For the 11th-century closing, the analysis relies on archaeological data and the closing of the previous channel as an exogenous shock. The time variation comes from the dating of archaeological sites. The geolocation of sites containing coins and buildings is used to construct panels of the probable location of economic activity. A branch within archaeology, Settlement Scaling Theory [@Ortman2020], argues for such approaches to infer historical economic activity, and archaeological evidence has also seen recent application within economics [@Davis2002; @Barjamovic2019; @Bakker2021Phonecians]. This paper employs a novel method to determine the probability that a coin or building finding was left for later archaeological discovery at any given time. Results show that a one percent change in market access led to a 13-19 percent decrease in the probability of coin findings and a 6-8 percent decrease in the probability of building findings. Denmark of the 11th century is very different from its 19th century counterpart. But despite differences in technology, culture, institutions, and religion, market access played a similar role in the 12th century as it did in the 19th century, providing evidence of (temporal) external validity of the effect of geography on prosperity.

A separate but related contribution of this paper is in understanding the effects of infrastructure. Some of the most expensive and extensive projects that a society can undertake are infrastructure projects. Infrastructure changes distances between people. Infrastructure changes the geography. But infrastructure is endogenous to outcomes of interest.  If a dramatic increase in e.g. population density is observed following infrastructure, it is difficult to identify whether this is because it was just constructed in an already thriving place. To measure the effect of infrastructure by itself we have to model the human out of the equation statistically. There are different standardized ways of doing this with varying degrees of credibility [@Redding2015]. This paper can be seen as an entirely new way of studying infrastructure change: By relying on changes in the natural endowments of it.

Although events like the ones studied in this paper are rare, there are still plenty of opportunities to investigate similar phenomena in the vast expanse of history. For instance, both the histories of Bruges and Königsberg/Kaliningrad are marked by the consequences of an unstable channel [@Houtte1966; @Charlier2011; @Britannica2018]. And climate change threatens to cause many similar events as a consequence of natural disasters [@IPCC2022]. The approach presented in this paper offers a feasible method to extract new knowledge from these events and many others like them. This enables new insights into economic geography, trade, climate economics, economic history and various related fields. 

This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 contains an overview of related literature. Section 3 presents the historical background. Section 4 presents the overall empirical strategy and two alternative measures for being affected by the channel. Section 5 gives a general overview of the data used. Section 6 demonstrates how the channel affected ship traffic to the affected region. Section 7 shows how the channel caused the population to grow. Section 8 covers mechanisms. Section 9 demonstrates the effect of the closed-up channel in the 1100s. Section 10 concludes. The project also has a public repository, which contains code, data and detailed documentation to reproduce all steps from raw data to the final regression results presented in this paper (www.github.com/christianvedels/A_perfect_storm_replication).

# 2. Literature review
This paper enters an important debate about the fundamental determinants of growth. Is geography or are institutions the fundamental cause? @Acemoglu2001 argue that extractive institutions set up by colonizing Europeans are partially to blame for the current low-income status of many African nations. @rodrik2004institutions argue that geography plays a limited role if institutions are kept constant. @Henderson2018satelite use satellite image data to show that geography through trade and agriculture can explain 47 percent of the worldwide variation in economic activity. @Ketterer2018 find that first nature does play a role but institutions are far more important even when a comparison is made within European regions. Most of this literature focuses on the macro-level, while the present paper is more local oriented. @Ager2020a show how a natural disaster can change relative city sizes. @Cermeno2019 show that institutions can create towns in otherwise unfavorable geography. In a way, the present paper shows the opposite. Population density can increase as a consequence of improved geography. But institutions had to adapt to the new opportunities given by the geography. It was only when both were in place, that the affected region would prosper. 

A second strand of the same literature springs from unified growth theory [@Galor2005; @Galor2011]. Evidence suggests, that Denmark was in a post-Malthusian regime in the 19th century. This implies, that a positive shock to productivity will cause both raised living standards and higher population density [@Jensen2022; @Klemp2016]. And this is indeed what the present work demonstrates to be the effect of improved market access. Important evidence of the Malthusian dynamics in unified growth theory comes from the variations in food productivity. @Ashraf2011 demonstrate that better technology and soil quality increased population density but not living standards. @Nunn2011a; @HeavyPlough2016 and @Dalgaard2020 demonstrate that variation in productivity of the land for food (the potato, the heavy plough and fish stock respectively) caused increased population density. @WinnersAndLosers2022 even demonstrated how productivity of the land for food affected land inequality, and @clark2014 demonstrate the influence on literacy. Of course, the ground might be endowed with other determinants of growth like coal [@ORourkeCoal2021] or peat [@CoalPeatPaper]. The risk, however, is to overlook other important geographical determinants. Geography is more than the soil types of the land. It is also the shape of of the land. It is also *geomorphology*. This perspective has received less attention with @Diamond1997 as a notable exception. This paper highlights the importance of changing geomorphology in shaping market access and fueling development.

Furthermore this paper contributes to a line of literature exploiting time variation in effective distances to explore the importance of market access and trade for economic development. @Feyrer2021 uses the closing of the Suez Canal in 1967-1975 to show that pair-wise distances between countries affect trade and trade affects income. @Maurer2008 estimate the social savings introduced by the Panama Canal in the tradition of @Fogel1964. @rauch2022a measured the increased market access from the Panama Canal and use this to measure the elasticity of market access to population growth. @Bakker2021Phonecians demonstrate that trade-inducing geography even in the time of the Phoenicians seemingly caused prosperity as measured by the density of archaeological findings. The unique contribution of this paper is that the change in infrastructure studied is not the consequence of human decisions. 

The search for time-variation in effective distances is motivated by the simultaneity of trade and income. If there is trade, then there is growth (in theory) and if there is growth, then this also promotes trade. As a result, there has been discussion on the relationship between trade and growth at least since @ricardo1817principles. This paper builds on a strand of this debate arising from @Frankel1999. The insight of @Frankel1999 is that geography (distances specifically) is the source of variation in trade. Using changes in trade predicted by distances can then  be used to estimate this otherwise simultaneous relationship. Specifically, the paper estimates a gravity model and utilizes its predictions as an instrument of trade. @Rodriguez2001 caution that distance between countries is correlated with other things, which also determine growth, e.g. distance to the equator, institutions, etc. When this is taken into account it is no longer possible to demonstrate an effect. Yet the work of @Frankel1999 still stands as an important inspiration, which motivates the seemingly paradoxical hunt for time variation in distances.

If there is time variation it is possible to include unit fixed effects, which controls for these geographical confounders and the effect of trade on economic development can better be identified. But how does one go about and find distances that are not constant? Many ingenious ideas have been used: The opening and closing of canals [@Feyrer2021; @rauch2022a]; the emergence of new transport technologies such as steam [@Pascali2017] and aeroplanes  [@Feyrer2019] and of course blockades and other sudden changes in trade policy [@Bernhofen2004; @Etkes2015; @Juhasz2018]. However, all of these approaches centrally rely on human-induced variation in distances. This paper is the first to use an entirely *natural* natural experiment to understand this relationship. A recurring concern is the endogeneity of the source of variation in distances. But in the present paper, the shock that induces changes in distances is practically completely independent and random, and it is isolated to a specific region. This adds important validity. 

The present work is also related to a literature concerned with the importance of infrastructure projects in the form of channels and railways and how they shaped the industrializing economies. Infrastructure improves market access. A large number of papers show how this shaped everything from land value, health, industrialization, manufacturing and the persistent location of modern-day economic activity [@Donaldson2016; @Berger2017; @Hornbeck2019; @Bogart2019; @Zimran2020a; @Bogart2022]. My contribution is to limit worries about the endogeneity of infrastructure. Using a natural experiment, worries of endogeneity are limited. @Redding2015 classify identification strategies for the effect of infrastructure into three broad classes: Planned routes instruments [@BaumSnow2007], historical routes instruments [@Duranton2012] or inconsequential units instruments [@Berger2017]. All of these have their separate advantages and disadvantages. As such it has become typical for papers within this literature to express which of these boxes the identification fits into. However, the strategy employed here does not fall neatly into any of these boxes and must be regarded as an innovation. As such, this paper also serves to demonstrate the feasibility of a new approach to be adopted to similar events across the world.

# 3. Historical background
A fjord is a navigable inlet of water - typically found in Northern Europe and in particular Scandinavia. Fjords act as important natural infrastructure by connecting otherwise remote regions with convenient waterways. The word 'fjord' takes its origin in the Proto-Indo-European 'pertu-', which evolved into many of the words describing roads, access points, or infrastructure more broadly. E.g. 'pertu-' is also the origin 'port', 'per' as in per capita [@EtymFjord]. This demonstrates how fjords even in prehistory were perceived as important primarily in terms of their transportation capabilities. The fjords acted as the Scandinavian highways in a time before modern transportation systems. Looking at a map, it is noticeable that many Scandinavian towns and cities, even today, are located on the shore of a fjord.[^2211041]

[^2211041]: Stockholm, Oslo, Gothenburg, Bergen, Stavanger, Odense, Aalborg and Roskilde just to name a few important cities from around Scandinavia, which fit this description. 

The story of the present paper is centred on the so-called Lim-fjord, named after the high concentration of subterranean lime [@lexlimfjord2017]. It is located in Northwestern Denmark, more specifically the Northern part of Jutland (the peninsula 'jutting' out of Germany). The region is located conveniently at the heart of Scandinavia, between modern Norway and Sweden. Before the 1100s, the Limfjord had both an eastern and a western opening, making it a safer shortcut for ships wanting to avoid the rough sea of Skagerak - the strait between Norway and Denmark. It is no surprise that the Limfjord developed into the main hub for Vikings to gather before sailing west to trade (and pillage) [@Rasmussen1966]. In the centre of the Limfjord, the settlement of Aggersborg grew large and would become the location of the largest of a series of so-called ring castles constructed in the 10th century when the Jelling dynasty (of which Harald Bluetooth is probably the most well-known) consolidated power over an emerging Danish state [@pedersen2014]. But this would not last. The western opening would close and the local economy would stagnate, as shown by the analysis of the present paper.

The last historical evidence of the use of a western opening was in 1085. King Canute IV gathered his fleet in the Limfjord, to sail west and uphold his ‘claim’ to the English throne after his great uncle Canute II ('the great') who had been King of the so-called North Sea empire consisting of England, Denmark, Norway and parts of Sweden [@Spejlborg2012]. The sailors and soldiers rebelled against Canute IV, the fleet never left Denmark and he was killed when seeking refuge in Saint Alban’s church in the town of Odense in 1085. He was later sainted for this and earned the nickname ‘the holy’ [@Pajung2012]. This event marks the last attempt at gathering a Viking fleet in Denmark to sail west. Never again would Vikings be able to use the western channel. Never again would Danish Vikings try to conquer England [@Roesdahl2009]. 

The next time, this channel shows up in history is in the writings of the early historian Saxo @saxo. Saxo reports in the past tense that there 'used to' be a convenient western channel.[^2205091] There is some uncertainty surrounding the timing of the writings of Saxo. But it is known that it was around the year 1200, and the historian, @Mortensen2018, notes that the year 1208 is most likely. Therefore, it can be determined that the western channel probably closed sometime between 1085 and 1208. This approximate timing is supported by geological surveys. By drilling through the layers of soil and deposits, geologists have demonstrated a change in the levels of salinity consistent with a closing channel around this time [@Christensen2004].

[^2205091]: @saxo book XIII, section 5. 

What followed was no less than a complete reorientation of the prosperity of the Limfjord region. The Eastern Limfjord – particularly the town of Aalborg - became an important centre of the herring trade between Hanseatic Lübeck and the rest of the Baltic [@sildeboom2022]. By the earliest counts of market town populations in 1672, Aalborg had become the largest Danish market town after the capital, Copenhagen. The Western Limfjord towns lagged far behind the Eastern Limfjord [@Degn1989]. The regional socio-economic and legal structure that developed would mirror the geography. The west coast was dangerous, difficult and costly for ships to approach [@Hald1833, p. 176]. In practice, western Limfjord market towns, mainly accessed the market, by travelling eastwards through the difficult-to-navigate waters of Løgstør in the middle Limfjord and then further on through the town of Aalborg (see Figure \ref{fig:main_map}). In several court cases in the 16th and 17th centuries, the western Limfjord market towns fought (unsuccessfully) for the right to trade independently of the whims of the Aalborg merchants [@ThistedLokalhistorie1974, p. 78-89], but the geography made it difficult. Ships would have to pass both Løgstør and Aalborg and only limited trade occurred [@Poulsen2019].

It is important to note that there was *some* trade to and from the region via the west coast. But this was under direct or indirect Aalborg authority. Only small boats were able to approach the west coast beach of Jutland directly (under perilous danger). But this was enough for a small consistent trade between Norway and the western Limfjord to be sustained. @Aagard1802 p. 30 reports that Thisted (in the west Limfjord) shipped off 6993 barrels of barley and 6832 barrels of oats in 1800. Of this 31 percent and 47 percent respectively were shipped directly from the dangerous west coast beaches, whereas the rest was shipped via Aalborg. Of this, we can assume that most went to Norway. In return, Norway would then ship timber to the region used for construction [@Christensen1735, p. 234]. However, this isolation would not persist. 

On the night between February 3rd and 4th, 1825 a storm flooded the narrow strip of land called 'Agger tange' (Agger Isthmus). The Agger Isthmus was located in a remote corner of the Limfjord and was sparsely populated. The few inhabitants (388 in the 1801 census) of the Agger parish were offered money to relocate to less dangerous places to live. Many of them settled further into the Limfjord [@Poulsen2019; @Poulsen2022]. The more remarkable effect was that on the local geography. The Limfjord and the North Sea were now connected. The geographical morphology had changed fundamentally. Shrubs and other plant material protecting the eroding coast were washed away and a shallow Agger channel had formed. 

The main effects of the breach happened in three stages. *First* there was a windfall gain in fish caught within the Limfjord (1825-1828) after which fishing within the Limfjord stagnated, while open ocean fishing grew. *Secondly*  the channel became navigable and caused a large influx of trade (1834-). *Thirdly* the influx of trade caused institutions and secondary infrastructure to adapt, which boosted local prosperity even more (1840-).[^2212131]

[^2212131]: For a thorough historiographical account see @Poulsen2022.

As for the *first effect*, the breach caused the salinity of the water to change and thus the fish (that otherwise had lived in brackish waters) fled. In this process, they were easy to catch and a few 'golden years' of fishing followed [@Poulsen2007]. This peaked around 1828, and what followed was a period of very low yields. Several species went extinct or near extinct [@Poulsen2019] and local fishermen had to adapt to fishing for other species in the open ocean instead of the fjord. Whether the benefit of trade outweighs the loss of food, was a topic of discussion even in contemporary times [@petersen1853oplysende, p. 1]. However, the results presented in the present work indicate that it was on average a benefit. One could be worried that the environmental impact of the channel invalidates the natural experiment. But the event reflects very well something that also occurs in human-decided infrastructure: There is an environmental impact when we fundamentally alter the geography. The role of infrastructure is to change geography into something more convenient for humans. 

The *second effect* was the increase in trade of the region. In 1834 ships started consistently travelling through the channel. Already in 1831, experiments were conducted. But it would not be until later, in 1834 that ships would pass consistently. The simple before/after impact to trade was large. The data from the sound toll register is used to document this econometrically later in this paper, but for now, it is also useful to note that some indicative direct but scattered quantitative evidence exists for this. Taking the case of the market town of Thisted, (after the channel) ideally located in the western Limfjord: In 1834, 6 ships were registered in the Thisted port, while in 1876 the same number was 62. The impact in terms of products traded was also large. In 1853 Thisted exported 24735 barrels of barley and 68091 barrels of oats [@ThistedLokalhistorie1974, p. 153-159]. Comparing these figures, to those reported by @Aagard1802 in 1800 (mentioned earlier), this is an increase of 354% and 997%  respectively. For the entire Limfjord, the effect was also substantial. In 1835, 19 ships used the Agger channel and in 1855 a total of 1805 ships used the channel [@Svalgaard1977].  Newspapers report of ships arriving from England from 1834 and forward [@ThistedAmtsavis1834; @RoskildeAmt1836; @ViborgStift1852]. This has led historians to conclude that a golden age of trade in the region had begun [@Poulsen2019; @Ravn1993]. 

The *third effect* was a process of institutional adaptation and even more infrastructure construction to accommodate this new trade-economy. @Redding2015 argue that an initial infrastructure investment might attract even more infrastructure to accommodate the growth. They argue that this will inflate the initial effect of infrastructure investment and this might be the reason why the empirical papers find a larger effect of infrastructure than theoretical predictions. This is exactly what happened in this case. In 1841, the King granted international trading rights - independent of Aalborg - to all the Limfjord market towns. In practice this meant customs offices in all these market towns. Previously only Aalborg had a customs office. We can speculate that this was a matter of practicality given the new geography. With all the trade now coming through the Agger channel, it seemed self-defeating to maintain the administration of all the trade in Aalborg. The traffic itself was also a logistical problem for the ports. The market towns on the Limfjord coast only had very limited ports, and capacity was overwhelmed. This attracted investment in a series of new ports.[^2206011]

[^2206011]: Thisted got a port in 1841 [@Dioerup1842Thisted, p. 384-386]; Struer got a port in 1856 which was further expanded in 1864 [@Trap3, vol V, p. 467]; In 1857 a port was constructed in Lemvig [@Trap3, vol V, p. 474]; Nykøbing Mors had a port from 1788, but in 1843 it was purchased by the city to support trade [@Trap3, vol IV, p. 214]; Løgstør had a port from 1820 but it was expanded in 1852 [@Trap3, vol IV, pp. 399-400]

Another large infrastructure investment, the Frederik VII canal (1861), was attracted because of fears that the Agger channel would silt up. The sand would travel with the currents, and only a true local would know exactly when and where to approach the channel with ships. The depth of the Agger channel varied a lot. In 1845 it was 5 feet deep - in 1846 it was 9½ feet deep [@Petersen1877] and the traffic passing would vary together with this. 1800 ships used the channel in 1855. In 1860 it was only 93 and in 1867 only 28 [@Ravn1993]. Political pressure arose to permanently improve connectivity and market access within the region [@petersen1853oplysende]. For the time and the technology, this seemed most practical to achieve by doing something for the connection between the East and West Limfjord at Løgstør. At first, attempts were made in 1843 at clearing the silt out of the shallow waters of Løgstør [@Bergsoee1844, p. 311; @petersen1853oplysende, p. 4]. This would fail and eventually, a more expensive but feasible solution was found. It was decided to build a canal along the coast near Løgstør to circumvent these waters. 

A part of the story of secondary infrastructure also revolves around the introduction of steamships. In 1842 a permanent route by steam was established between Aalborg and Copenhagen and soon after the towns of the Limfjord were also interconnected via steamships [@Klem1967]. Steamships would be the vessel for the future important butter trade with origin in Esbjerg [@Lampe2015DanesUK], but the first attempt at establishing a Danish route - the steamship "Jylland" - took its origin in the Limfjord and the Agger channel [@Schovelin1891, p. 62]. However, by then the Agger channel had become more shallow and this put a natural limit on the size of the ship, which merely had a draught of five feet [@Lassen1883]. The Agger channel, would eventually completely silt up, but before this happened another channel (approximately in the same location) would open in 1867 [@Petersen1877]. This is the channel - called the Thyborøn channel. But this was only navigable from 1875, for which reason, there was a temporary break in ship traffic between 1867 and 1875. 

The problems with the navigability of the western Limfjord channels probably contributed to the choice of Esbjerg as the location of a large port for Danish/British trade - rather than somewhere in the Limfjord. After the success of artificially establishing a safe port in Esbjerg [@Lampe2015DanesUK], and due to increasing concerns that the Thyborøn channel would also silt up, it was decided to establish a series of groins along the North Western Coast of Denmark in 1875. This would protect the area from coastal erosion and secure the existence of a western channel of the Limfjord to this day. 

# 4. Empirical strategy
This paper identifies three main effects: The effect of the channel on population, the effect of the channel on trade, and the effect when a similar channel closed in the 1100s on economic activity. However, the empirical strategy is similar across all. The events used here are by themselves isolated exogenous shocks limited to a specific time and a specific region. The effect of the channel, can therefore simply be computed as the change in an outcome in the areas affected by the channel compared to the areas not affected by it. This generally takes the form of a classical event-study specification.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eq501}
\log(y_{it})= \alpha_t + \alpha_i + \sum_{j=1787}^{1901} 1[t=j]Affected_{i}\beta_{j} + \varepsilon_{it}.
\end{equation}

Here $y_{it}$ is the outcome of interest (e.g. population) in a parish $i$ at time $t$. $t=1801$ is used as the reference. $1[t=j]$ is an indicator taking the value 1, when $t=j$ and zero otherwise. $Affected_{i}$ measures how much parish $i$ was affected by the new channel. Therefore $\beta_j$ represents the time-varying effect of being affected by the channel. That is, how much larger is e.g. log(Population) in affected parishes than in non-affected parishes when the general population trends and initial sizes have been accounted for? Whether a specific parish is affected by the channel is measured in two distinct ways, one is atheoretical and based on a simple dummy, and another is inspired by theory and based on estimates of how the channel affected local market access. On one hand, it is beneficial to have a simple binary measure for locations affected or not affected. On the other hand, it is probably not realistic that the effect is homogeneous across various locations. But modelling this requires assumptions on the spatial pattern of the effect of the channel. This motivates the use of both.

The dummy-measure of being affected is constructed by a simple heuristic of categorizing parishes into different parts of the Limfjord. This is used in the following regression setup: 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eq502}
\begin{split}
\log(y_{it})= \alpha_t + \alpha_i + \sum_{j=1787}^{1901} 1[t=j] \times I[i\in west]\beta_{j,w} + \sum_{j=1787}^{1901} 1[t=j] \times I[i\in middle]\beta_{j,m} \\
+ \sum_{j=1787}^{1901} 1[t=j] \times I[i\in east]\beta_{j,e} + \varepsilon_{it}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

The region directly affected by the channel is the Western Limfjord (see historical background) while the Middle and Eastern Limfjord were affected indirectly. For this reason, the parameters of interest are the $\beta_{j,w}$'s, which measures the average change in the outcome in logs - approximate percentages for small values. Parishes are categorized as being 'Limfjord' parishes if they are closer to the Limfjord than any coast. The Western and Eastern Limfjord were separated by difficult-to-navigate waters at Løgstør (see historical background). A roughly northwest, southeast line going through Løgstør is defined by the coordinates (57.044185, 9.186837) and (56.958951, 9.275585). This separates the eastern and western Limfjord in a conventional sense. A buffer zone of 20 km around this line is defined as the 'middle' Limfjord. Any parish west of this buffer zone is categorized as 'west' and any parish east of this is categorized as 'east'. Figure \ref{fig:main_map} illustrates all of this information.

Estimates of Market Access are  motivated by the spatial heterogeneous effect of the channel. Some parishes had more benefit than others since they were closer (in cost distance) to the new waterway. The change in Market Access is estimated and used in the following regression setup: 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eq503}
\log(y_{it})= \alpha_t + \alpha_i + \sum_{j=1787}^{1901} 1[t=j] \times \Delta log(MA_i)\beta_{j} + \varepsilon_{it}.
\end{equation}

Here $\Delta log(MA_i) = log(MA_{i,after}) - log(MA_{i,before})$ is the change in log market access as defined below. The parameters of interest are the $\beta_{j}$'s, which measure the elasticity of the outcome to market access.  Market Access is computed based on the cost distance approach following @rauch2022a and inspired by a vast literature using similar methods [@Harris1954; @Redding2008; @Donaldson2016]. The change in market access comes from the change in the set of effective ports. After the 1834 channel opened, the western and middle Limfjord became viable ports for international cargo. 

The Sound Toll Register contains ports used for international cargo trade. Most of these are coastal market towns. Most trade went via the coastal market towns simply because it was legally required to do so [@Degn1989]. Goods would be produced in the countryside and carried to the local market town to be sold. Constructing any measures of this process requires a sensible reduction of all cost distances between $H$ ports and $P$ parishes. In this regard, Tobler's first law of geography is useful: *"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."* - @Tobler1970. Estimating the Market Access is one solution to this problem, which is theoretically motivated [@eaton2002], follows Tobler's law and has seen wide empirical use [@Harris1954; @Hanson2005; @Redding2008; @Donaldson2016]. The most useful property of this approach is that for every location, it returns a single number, which expresses how close that location is to all other locations. Market access is computed as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:MA2}
{MA}_p = \sum_{h \in H} [CostDist(p, h; \alpha) + 1]^\theta
\end{equation}

Here $H$ is the set of all available ports (H for harbour). $h$ is a specific port and $p$ is a specific parish. $CostDist(p, h; \alpha)$ is the relative cost of travelling from parish $p$ to port $h$ given the parameter $\alpha$ (defined below). 

The core aim of this entire exercise is to gain insights into how this measure changes with the breach namely ${MA}_p|No\:channel$ and ${MA}_p|channel$. Quiet simply, this comes from the change in the set of available ports $H\rightarrow H^*$. $H$ is all the consistently available ports before 1834. $H^*$ is those consistently available after 1834. The estimated conditional market access can then be expressed as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:MA3}
\begin{split}
{MA}_{p}|No\:channel &= {MA}_{p}|H \\
{MA}_{p}|channel &= {MA}_{p}|H^*.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Here $H$ contains all ports observed in the Sound Toll Register more than once but leaving out the ports in the middle and western Limfjord. $H^*$ includes these. To be accurate, these ports existed both before and after. But before the breach, they saw only very limited use. As this paper documents this dramatically changed with the introduction of the channel. What ${MA}_{p}|channel$ measures is the market access after the five Limfjord ports become suitable for international cargo because of the channel. $\theta$ is the distance elasticity, which in the default specification is assumed to be -1 as in @Harris1954 and @rauch2022a. CostDistance is computed based on an assumed $\alpha = 10$ times cost of land travel over sea travel. Addtional details are described in Appendix A. Figure \ref{fig:main_map} shows the change in Market Access across Denmark given the newly available ports following the breach.

# 5. Data description
For trade data @Svalgaard1977 reports the number of ships passing the channel each year. But for more detailed data with observations both before and after, the present work relies on the Sound Toll Registers from Elsinore (of Shakespeare's *Hamlet* fame), north of Copenhagen. Denmark taxed ships passing through from 1420 to 1857 and thorough accounts were kept of all ships (1.8 million in total) [@gobel2010oresundstolden]. This data has been digitized by @soundtoll_data. This data contains information on the origin and destination of each ship. Conveniently, these ports have even been labelled with coordinates. A total of 126 ports in present-day Denmark are reported in the period 1750-1855. The sum of traffic to and from these ports is used as a measure of the level of trade to and from that destination. 

Census data was obtained from Link Lives [@mathiesen2022linklives]. For the purposes here, it contains individual-level information such as occupation, age, gender, and the parish of residence. In the main analysis it is aggregated into parish-level population counts. Data is available for 1787, 1801, 1834, 1840, 1845, 1860, 1880 and 1901. I manually made a cross-walk between the census data parishes and the historical parish borders (which is available in this projects public repository). Only parishes which are consistently observed throughout all the censuses are used. This leaves 1589 of 1783 parishes to be used in the analysis. 

This census data is also used to test plausible mechanisms. This is done using age, place of birth, gender and occupation. All of the occupational descriptions in the census were transcribed into HISCO codes using a procedure described by @2023HISCO. HISCO codes are a standard way of categorizing historical occupations. The census data contains an occupational description for each person such as "he is a fisherman and a farmer". For the years 1787, 1801, 1845 and 1880 these already have HISCO codes assigned to them [@ddd_method2015]. This gives 3.7 mil. pairs of descriptions and HISCO codes. This serves as training data for a machine learning algorithm, which learns to generate HISCO codes from occupational descriptions. This algorithm was then used to enrich the remaining census data with HISCO codes. 1000 random HISCO codes from the algorithm where checked to be 96 percent accurate. 

Table \ref{tab:desc_pop} contains summary statistics for the main variables used in the analysis. 'Fishing' is the count of all fishermen - by HISCO code - in a specific parish. 'Manufacturing' is the count of all people working in manufacturing jobs. These were found by categorizing all the top 100 occupations found in the census as manufacturing or something else. 'Born in different county' counts the number of people who were born in a different county, than where they now live. 'Young children per woman' is the ratio of children aged between 1 and 5 to women aged between 15 and 45, which is used as an indicator of fertility. Figure \ref{fig:bal} shows the standardized distribution of all of these before the event with the obvious exception of 'Born in different county' which is only observed from 1845. From this figure it should be noticed that there is a large overlap between variables of interest before the Agger Istmus breach. But the pre-event difference is also noticeable. This is addressed in section 7 and Appendix D.3. 

Archaeological data is obtained from a public registry of archaeological findings. All Danish archaeological sites are registered in a publicly available database. The data is geo-referenced, categorized by type and dated to a certain interval of years. Every coordinate was matched to a parish using the parish borders described above. The archaeological dating of the site was then used to construct a panel of economic activity. Details of this are outlined in section 9.

# 6. The effect on trade
After the Agger channel opened in 1834, there was a substantial increase in trade in the region. Figure \ref{fig:channel} shows the traffic passing the Agger channel and later Thyborøn channel from 1835 to 1871 reported by @Svalgaard1977. Figure \ref{fig:Sound_toll} shows the more detailed statistics from the Sound Toll Database. This illustrates the sum of traffic to and from ports on a log scale. An important caveat is that the Sound Toll Database only counts ships that would go eastwards and pass the Sound Toll at Elsinore. However, it should be noted how practically no traffic with origin or destination in the western Limfjord is replaced by a substantial amount afterwards. And this is no quirk of uncertain data. In fact, the amount of trade is relatively stable. This stability is only briefly interrupted when Denmark actively entered the Napoleonic War in 1807-1814 [@Feldbaek2015].

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:channel} and \ref{fig:Sound_toll} unmistakably highlights the introduction of trade to the middle and western Limfjord following the creation of the Agger channel. While there is a certain level of traffic prior to 1834, it lacks consistency, aligning with historical sources that confirm the channel becoming navigable in that year. Unsurprisingly, a regression version of this (which can be found in appendix B) shows the same across many common specifications for this type of estimation. In this specific case, I prefer the simple before/after estimate to any more advanced specification. This is because zero traffic is a very reasonable counterfactual: There would still be no shipping traffic without the channel. As such the comparison of before and after, is the most simple and reasonable estimate of the effect. This also allows us to use the full account from the channel itself. This reveals a sizeable effect. When traffic was at its maximum in the year 1855, 1805 ships used the channel. It is also seen that this traffic would diminish as the channel started silting up, but pick up again soon after, when the Thyborøn channel - in almost the same location - became navigable in 1868.

The analysis reveals a notable and immediate, and lasting surge in trade, which - according to the historical descriptions - would have placed strain on local infrastructure, prompting further investment and ultimately leading to a larger population in the region. The subsequent section will delve into this aspect in greater detail.

} \label{fig:pop1}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:pop1} shows regression results from estimating equation \ref{eq:eq501}. Panel (a) shows the simplest estimate, where being affected by the Agger channel is defined as a dummy for being in the western Limfjord. This allows parameters to be interpreted as the percentage increase in the entire affected region caused by the channel. By 1901 the parishes of the Western Limfjord region had a 23.6 percent larger population than what would have been expected by parishes from elsewhere and the population in 1801. Panel (b) shows the results when 'affected' is defined as estimated improved market access from the channel. This column shows that by 1901, affected areas had experienced a population growth equivalent to an elasticity of market access of 1.59.[^2306041] 

[^2306041]: This is similar to the magnitude found for the Panama Canal by @rauch2022a.

The relative delay of the effect should be noted. It is only by 1860, that a positive effect on the size of the affected population is observed. And for the market access approach it even seems like there is a slight negative effect immediately after the channel became navigable. Combined with the knowledge obtained from the section 6 on trade and section 3 on the historical background, it has thus been demonstrated, that the channel caused trade, but the population would not grow before a delay. This delay is timed with the adaptation of local infrastructure and institution. It is the new port projects, independent trading rights, the improved waterways around Løgstør, and so on, which likely triggered the large effect of the Agger channel.

The identifying assumption is that affected parishes would have developed similarly to unaffected parishes had the channel not appeared. This is inherently not something that can be tested. But it is possible to check, if the trends are parallel prior to the shock. If this was the case, this would make the assumption more likely. If these areas did not show signs of differential growth patterns before, then it is more likely that the differential growth patterns after the channel is caused by the channel.

From Figure \ref{fig:pop1} it can be observed that there is no difference in 1787. It is also possible to robustify the results against the choice of comparison group by running the same regression using a set of alternative feasible subgroups of parishes. Figure \ref{fig:pop2} shows exactly this. It shows the multiverse of all feasible choices of subgroups [@Steegen2016multiverse] for which the analysis could have been carried out, and the last panel shows all the feasible parameters for market access computation, which could have been assumed. Panel (a) shows that the default specification is within the estimated effect given any feasible alternative comparison group. The same is the case for the same subsets of parishes, which could have been used for the market access approach. Estimates from different parameters of the market access function are not directly comparable. Interpretation depends on the values of $\alpha$ and $\theta$ described in section 4. But alternative parameters for the market access function would all have generated positive results, leading to the same qualitative conclusion. As for pre-trends, Appendix C.2. contains results for the parameter for 1787. None of the alternative specification show any pretrends. Another potential worry is balance. This is addressed by correcting for pre-treatment characteristics using the doubly-robust DiD estimator suggested by @Callaway2021did. The results of this are shown in Appendix C.3. The effect of the channel is robust to all of this.

What remains now to is to document the causal chain. The channel caused the population size to increase. But by what means? And is it even possible to draw generalizable conclusions from this? Mechanisms and external validity are addressed in the following two sections.

# 8. Mechanisms behind the population increase

  \caption{\label{fig:DAG} Mechanism}
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Plots/dag_mechanism.png}
  \parbox{0.7\textwidth}{

}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For population growth to occur, the people must come from somewhere. The population growth could be a result of new people born, living longer or it could be people migrating into the affected region from the outside. Using the census data, it is possible to investigate the effects from migration and fertility. A second order question, is then what aspect of the channel caused migration or fertility. There are two overall possibilities for a channel which gives access to the sea: Markets becoming available or fishing becoming available. This is all reflected in the DAG of figure \ref{fig:DAG}. The breach of the Agger isthmus had two principal (yet unobserved) effects: Access to fish and access to markets. We do however observe the number of fishermen, and we do observe people working in manufacturing. This in turn is the cause of both fertility via a Malthusian mechanism and migration into the area because of the new opportunities. The combination of these layers of effects drive the observed population growth. But how important was each element?

Figure \ref{fig:mechanism} shows the results from testing the suggested mechanism. All the panels contain the parameters of a regression of the form described by equation \ref{eq:eq501}. Panel (a) shows the effect on the number of fishermen in the affected parishes as outcome. Panel (b) shows the effect on the number of people working in a manufacturing occupation in the affected parishes. Panel (c) shows the effect on internal migration measured as the share of people born in a different county than where they currently live. Panel (d) shows the effect on fertility measured as the child women ratio (children aged 1 to 5 per woman of fertile age, 15 to 45). All of the regressions illustrated in the plots use market access approach to define whether a parish is affected or not. For manufacturing and fishing I use $log(occupation+1)$[^2306042] as the outcome variable. The variables for fertility and migration are already in ratios and thus used as level outcomes. 

[^2306042]: In doing so, I am aware that log(x+1) transformations can be problematic. But in this case the results, and their interpretation, is qualitatively the same when using any of the alternatives suggested by @chen2023loglike.

From panel (a) a steady increase in the amount of fishermen in the area throughout the period is observed. It is of a similar magnitude to the overall population growth. @Poulsen2007 show how an effect of the channel was a collapse of Limfjord fishing due to the increased salinity when the saline ocean broke through. A hitherto open question is whether open ocean fishing (which the channel enabled) were able to offset this negative effect. This was indeed the case: Fishing became an approximately 15-20 percent more common profession in the area, laying the grounds for a future industry. Today, Thyborøn, located just at the mouth of the channel, is one of Denmark's main fishing ports, accounting for 25% of the Danish catch in 2021.[^2301081]

[^2301081]: Data extracted from @MinisterietforFodevarer2022.

From panel (b) it is noticeable how there is essentially no development in manufacturing positions until something rapidly happens between 1880 and 1901, which is timed with the economic take-off in Denmark [@Khaustova2015]. The professions which received the highest level of growth within manufacturing is Factory Workers, Brick and Tile Moulders, Cigar Makers, Weavers and Blacksmiths. All professions thriving on water access.[^2304291] This together with panel (a) documents the existence of two of the proposed mechanisms: market access based manufacturing and fishing in the now accesible open ocean. 

[^2304291]: Based on occupational level simple difference in means of growth of manufacturing professions in the West Limfjord compared to the rest of Denmark. Not included here. 

For both occupations it should be noted, that the rate of increase in these is not enough to account for the overall population increase. Not even all occupations can account for this. When a similar regression is run but with Fishermen as a share of the overall population as outcome (and likewise for manufacturing or any other occupation), then the result is negative. There were fewer people in any occupation as a share of the overall population. Event study plots from this can be found in the online repository of the paper. This demonstrates, that all though these professions grew comparatively to the rest of the country, it is not the nominal amount of workers in any profession that carried the overall effect. It was their families. 

Panel (c) starts unraveling how these new opportunities turned into population growth. From 1845 the censuses start recording where people where born. An indicator of whether people have migrated into the region comes from measuring how many reported being born in a different county than the one they currently live in. Of course, it would be interesting to see data before 1834 when the channel became navigable, but since most of the population growth from the channel would only occur later, this is adequate as a proxy. The results demonstrates that these were an increasingly lower share of the population compared to other parishes and national trends. 

A key question for all studies of infrastructure is growth or reallocation [@Redding2015]. This documents that it is unlikely that this is not the driving force behind the populaiton increase in this case. On the other hand, panel (d) documents, that there was indeed also increased fertility. More children were born or survived beyond infancy per woman of fertile age. This indicates that the main source of population increase was intrinsic growth. This fits well with the post-Malthusian dynamics of Denmark at the time Which imply, that a positive shock to productivity will cause higher population density as a reflection of higher living standards [@Jensen2022; @Klemp2016]. The channel seemingly caused an intrinsic improvement in life quality of those who were affected.

# 9. The reverse natural experiment and external validity

## 9.1. Method and data
If a causal effect has been identified, one implication is that it should be replicable across heterogeneous environments [@Peters2016]. This is the causal reasoning behind the classical arguments for replication studies and concerns of external validity. But it also gives a clue to a way of approaching it. What is truly sought after, when external validity is pursued is a repetition of the same event in a completely different environment. If the effect is the same, this is evidence, that the effect is not just some quirk of the particular setup. It is rare, that we can do this in the social sciences. But the setting of this particular paper allows for it. 

The Limfjord region was endowed with convenient natural infrastructure after 1834. But this was not the first time the region had seen a convenient western channel. In fact, the region was endowed with a similar channel in a similar location before the 1100s - see the historical background. But sometime between 1085 and 1208, the channel closed. In other words, the same natural experiment occurred. Only this time in reverse. Denmark in the 1100s had recently converted from paganism to Christianity, was dominated by Viking traditions and technology and did not have the benefit of modern science or enlightenment [@Roesdahl2022; @milkandbutter]. Denmark of the 1100s is different from Denmark of 1834 in terms of all the important factors which otherwise impact economic performance in the long run: Culture, institutions and technology. It is almost like comparing two entirely separate countries. But instead of comparing two countries separated in space, they are separated in time by 700 years. This makes it the ideal testing ground for providing some external validity to the event of 1834.

However, a key problem in this is that the amount of available data of the 1100s is very sparse, to say the least. There is a single land-value census of 1231 which is currently being digitized [@Poulsen2017]. One available approach is the use of archaeological evidence as an indication of economic activity or population density. The idea comes out of the positive archaeological tradition of Settlement Scaling Theory, which simply utilizes that a larger settlement will generate more things to be discovered by archaeologists [@Ortman2020]. This approach has also seen application within economic history and economics more broadly [@Davis2002; @Bakker2021Phonecians]. A methodological innovation of the present paper is to also exploit the time dimension in archaeological data to construct a panel of likely locations of economic activity.

The Danish registry of archaeological sites 'Fund og fortidsminder' contains data on all archaeological sites reported by Danish museums and the national agency of culture and palaces. This data is publicly available[^2305151]. The data contains a specific coordinate of the finding, a type (e.g. if it were coins, a former house, burial mount, etc.), and a range of years to which it is dated. The current version of the database contains 290.524 findings in total. But this includes all kinds of sites from the earliest palaeolithic until a few years before the present time. The focus is narrowed a bit on what likely contains useful information in this particular analysis. This is done by limiting the data to only sites which are dated to somewhere between 750 and 1500 CE and only two types of findings: Coins and Buildings. Coins indicate that some amount of trade took place in and around this particular site. Buildings directly reflect population density. More people require more buildings, which increases the probability that remains will be left for archaeologists to discover. The database contains 3411 coin findings and 4396 findings of buildings. These observations are used to construct panels of the likely historical locations of economic activity.

[^2305151]: All the data can be downloaded here: https://www.kulturarv.dk/fundogfortidsminder/Download/

An example seems beneficial at this point: The finding with id 338 is a finding of coins, which can be dated to somewhere between 1300 and 1535. The site of the finding is at the decimal coordinate (14.92617, 55.02614). This is within the historic parish of Pedersker on the island of Bornholm. This means that some activity which caused coins to be used happened around this location in this time frame. A simple approach would then be to mark Pedersker with a '1', indicating that coins were found here for the years 1300-1535. Applying this principle to all parishes would then allows for the construction of an entire panel of the likely location of economic activity. The descriptive results from this procedure is shown in Figure \ref{fig:arch_desc} (details about this in the following). However, this measure causes places with more uncertain dating to be more likely to have economic activity associated with it. This is simply because the coins in Pedersker would show up multiple times, whereas a coin associated with e.g. a single year would only show up once, even though the coin with a smaller range arguable contains more information. Moreover, it does not address the main question of interest with this data: What is the probability that a specific year was the correct year of a finding being generated.

It is useful to think about this in terms of the probabilities the data represents. What is observed is information on the probability of years being associated with a finding: $P(t|finding)$ (e.g. 1300 to 1535). However, what is of interest is the opposite - $P(finding|t)$ - the probability that e.g. 1350 is the correct year. Moreover, the amount of findings is of little use. It is no surprise that archaeologist find more things in places, where they have already found something. The intensive, not the extensive, margin is of interest. $P(\{findings\}|t)$ expresses the probability of any finding being generated given a specific time. Notice $\{findings\}$ with the curly brackets added. The curly brackets indicate the event that one or more findings is associated with a particular parish. However, this adds further complication to the analytical expression. It can be derived[^2329042], that the formula for this can be expressed as 

[^2329042]: See more details in the Appendix D.1. and code for replicating this procedure in the public repository of this project https://github.com/christianvedels/A_perfect_storm_replication

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\label{eq:arch1}
P_i(\{findings\}|t)&=\left[1-\prod_{c=1}^{K_i} \left( 1 - P(t|finding_c) \right)\right] P(\{findings\}) \\
\textit{Assuming P(t|finding) is uniform:} \\
P(t|finding)& = 1[t\in [Y_{min}^c;Y_{max}^c]] \left(\frac{1}{Y_{max}^c - Y_{min}^c}\right)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $P_i(\{findings\}|t)$ is the probability of any findings (coins or buildings) having been generated at time $t$ for later discovery in parish $i$. This is calculated over all the archaeological findings in that parish $K_i$ and the particular dating distribution of each finding (given by a range of years $Y_{min},\: Y_{max}$). All of the is multiplied by the prior probability that any findings would have been generated.[^2304051] Estimating this probability for every year and for every parish generates a panel of economic activity across Denmark. 

[^2304051]: Whether archaeologists' dating ranges should be interpreted as a uniform distribution is not given. An obvious alternative is to assume a normal distribution, where the uncertainty represent a 95 percent confidence interval from the distribution. Results using this approach are shown in Appendix D.3. These results are qualitatively equivalent. 

Luckily - despite the complex analytical expressions - it is possible to draw samples from this distribution. This is quite simply a matter of drawing a random year in the range of years, that a particular finding has been dated to. This is done repeatedly. Each time it is checked whether any particular year and parish pair has any finding associated with it in this random draw. These are all draws from the probability distribution of interest and with enough samples an adequate representation of it comes from simply counting the frequency with which draws are successful. This is done using a 1000 samples. 

This data enters the general approach presented in section 4. The outcome in this case the probability that a coin finding was generated in a specific parish in a specific year (or $\pm 25$ within a specific year to be more exact).

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eq7_4}
P_i(Coin|t) = \alpha_t + \alpha_i + \sum_{j = 750, j\neq 1000}^{1500} 1[t=j]\times Affected_{i}\beta_{j}  + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{equation}

As before, $Affected$ is measured both in terms of a dummy and the estimated change in market access. Inference is made with a clustered bootstrap, which resamples the panel from the 1000 samples drawn from the distribution of equation \ref{eq:arch1}. A further concern is that soil types might cause endogeneity. It might be that places with more fertile soil types had a differential developmental path [@HeavyPlough2016; @WinnersAndLosers2022]. The western part of the Limfjord is rich in fertile soil. Soil types might also influence the rate of survival of archaeological sites. 

To counter this, propensity score matching is used. The aim of this is to ensure that parishes affected by the channel closing are compared to parishes, which in terms of soil type, are similar parishes to those not affected. The propensity score is estimated using extreme gradient boosting trees [@chen2016xgboost], which is a machine learning technique suitable for classification using tabular data, which can be thought of as a generalization of a random forest [@Breiman2001]. Data on soil types are obtained from @Pedersen2019. Only the soil types found in at least 10 percent of parishes are used, otherwise the model overfits by utilizing the fingerprint of allocation of more unique soil types. 
 The procedure estimates a model, which predicts the probability (propensity), that a given parish is a west Limfjord parish based on the soil types in the parish. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eq7_5}
P_i(Affected|\mathbf{X}_i) = f(\mathbf{X}_i)+\varepsilon_i
\end{equation}

Each parish in the west Limfjord, is then matched with a counterpart, which has the most similar propensity score outside the Limfjord region. This represents the match with the most similar soil type. This is done without replacement ensuring that each parish is matched with *one* other parish which at the same time is not the match of any other affected parish. Figure \ref{fig:prop_score} shows the propensity score of parishes included in the sample before and after matching. Notice that after matching, the distributions of propensity scores are almost identical across the west Limfjord and the reference group.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:arch_desc} displays the mean number of coin findings in various regions of the Limfjord as well as in the remainder of the country, spanning from 750 to 1500. The plot examines whether the closing of a channel between 1085 and 1208 had an impact on the west Limfjord region, causing it to fall behind the other regions. The average number of coin findings for each region is calculated using Generalized Additive Models (GAM). A coin is included in the analysis if its dating range falls within the lower and upper bounds of the x-axis.  The plot demonstrates a gradual rise in coin findings, especially in the east Limfjord and the rest of the country, following the channel closure, whereas the west and middle Limfjord regions remain at lower levels. This finding suggests that the west and middle Limfjord regions may have experienced an economic and commercial decline during this period. This reveals that an effect can be observed even with a straightforward approach. However, it seems that there might be a pre-trend. It seems like the effects starts before the channel closes entirely. But this could just be a quirk of uncertainty. More uncertain observations have more weight in this very simple descriptive plot. Results that accounts for this are presented in Figure \ref{fig:arch_reg} and \ref{fig:arch_reg_boot} and table \ref{tab:arch1}.

Figure \ref{fig:arch_reg} and table \ref{tab:arch1} provide more reliable estimations of the probability of archaeological findings being generated in the affected regions of the Limfjord. Figure \ref{fig:arch_reg_boot} shows the parameter distribution in 1350 yielded by the bootstrap procedure presented. The regression table presents the results of archaeological regressions for the full sample of all Denmark and a matched sample, using both the dummy definition of being affected and the change in market access approach. The outcome is the probability that a coin finding or building was generated in the area covered by that parish within $\pm 25$ years of the reported year. 

The parameters from the Market Access approach should be interpreted as semi-elasticities, i.e. how does the probability of a coin being generated change with a relative change in market access? These are approximately interpretable as percentage changes. E.g. a 1 percent decrease in Market Access led to a 13-19 percent change in the probability of a coin finding being generated in 1350 - 150 years after the channel closed (column 1 and 5). Equivalently, it led to a reduction in the chance of buildings being generated as archaeological findings by 6 to 8 percent (column 3 and 7). The parameters for the dummy approach can be interpreted as the change in the probability that findings were generated from a West Limfjord parishes compared to other parishes. In 1350, the chance of coin findings being generated had fallen by around 1.5 or 1.9 percent  (column 2 and 6), and the probability of buildings to become archaeological findings had decreased by 0.6 to 1 percent (column 4 and 8). 

For all these estimates it is seen, that there is a rather stable effect size before 1085-1208 of aproximately zero, but after this the probability sharply declines. Appendix D.2. provides tables of all parameters. It is worth considering whether these results can be spurious because of the added layer of uncertainty added by the Monte Carlo method. But the standard errors used take this added uncertainty into account. Figure \ref{fig:arch_reg_boot} shows parameter distribution in 1350 given by the bootstrap samples.

Whichever methodological alternatives are employed, the results show a large negative effect of the closure of the channel for the affected parishes. The results suggest that the closure of the channel between 1085 and 1208 had a significant impact on the west Limfjord regions, causing a decline in the probability of coin findings and buildings being generated in those areas. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the channel closure caused economic and commercial decline in the region. It is not possible to do an apples-to-apples comparison to the census data for the Agger channel of 1834. But it is certainly noteworthy that the parameters are of similar sign and magnitudes for these two channels in the same location. This corroborates the external validity of the main result: This type of channel is beneficial for regional development across very different societies.

# 10. Conclusion
Waterways, by determining market access, have a key role in determining the location of economic activity. We are all prisoners of geography, but what happens when the shackles are loosened? The unexpected emergence of the Agger channel in Denmark's western Limfjord region in the early 19th century serves as a useful example of this phenomenon. The channel brought new trade opportunities and revitalized a region that had been lagging behind its neighbours for centuries. However, the full benefits of the channel's improved connectivity were not realized until the local region adapted to the new opportunities. To fully grasp the regional distribution of prosperity, it is crucial to understand both geography and institutions, and how their interplay shapes economic outcomes. By studying events like the one described in this paper, we can gain new and deeper insights into the complex relationship between geography, institutions, market access, and society.

This paper introduces an entirely new approach to measuring the effects of infrastructure: The utilization of changing natural endowments of infrastructure. Because of the exogenous nature of the events studied they can be used to gain insight into the causal effects of infrastructure. It is demonstrated that channel availability causes more economic activity. This is demonstrated in terms of increased trade activity and of higher population densities in the 19th century and in terms of generation of archaeological sites containing coins and buildings in the 12th century. In the 19th century, the introduction of the Agger channel caused a 24 percent increase in the size of the population in affected regions compared to unaffected parishes. In the 12th century, the sudden unavailability of a similar channel caused a large decline in the levels of economic activity indicated by archaeological findings.

In a world of climate change and space innovation, a fundamental determinant of prosperity is changing: Distances. The opening of the north-west passage in the Arctic, the colonization of space, and flooding of large land masses are all possible scenarios that could lead to significant changes in distances. It is hard to know exactly what might happen, but a part of the answer relies on a better understanding of the universal relationship that humans have with the distances between us. The present work is a small contribution to that understanding. In two distinctly different societies - 700 years apart - changing the relative distances between humans with the same channel opening/closing played a similar role. 

Events like the Agger channel are rare, but the expanse of history offers many opportunities for similar studies. The breaking of a narrow isthmus in modern-day Belgium in 1134 created market opportunities for Bruges, which declined when the channel silted up in the 14th century [@Houtte1966; @Charlier2011]. Similarly, the history of Kaliningrad, is filled with consequences of the unstable channel around Pillau [@Britannica2018]. These events - and many more - can now be studied with the approach introduced in this paper.
