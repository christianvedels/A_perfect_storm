### Institutions vs geography
- Institutions are the primary driver of economic development (Acemoglu et al., 2001)
- Geography acts through institutions (Rodrik et al., 2004)
- Geography plays a role (which is smaller than instituions) (Ketterer and Rodr√≠guez-Pose, 2018)

### Geography
- Henderson et al. (2018): Geography explain 47 pct of nightlight variation
- Even large disruptions does not change long-run outcomes (Davis and Weinstein, 2002) $\rightarrow$ Path dependence or first nature geography?
- Bleakly and Lin (2012): Path dependence is part of the answer
- What about first nature? Extreme long-run: Diamond (1997); Allen et al. (2023); Matranga (2024)

- This map essentially shows the entire story I am going to tell you today 
- Market access improved because of new port becoming available 
- Imagine being a merchant in one of these dots before 1834

# Timeline

--

#### Pre-event: 
- 1085-1208: Natural western channel closed because of gradual land rises (since the last ice age)
- Limfjord towns lacked far behind the rest of the country

--

#### Event:
- 1825: Breach of Agger Isthmus
- 1834: Ships start consistently passing through a new natural channel 
- 1841: Independent trade rights to west Limfjord market towns 
- 1841-1860: 'Golden age of trade'
- 1860-1900: Population growth + changed occupational structure

- This newspaper clip is from a local newspaper 
- It is written with the hard to read 'Fraktur' font
- ...And it is also in Danish 
- But if you trust me, I can tell you that it says that a ship arrived with coal from Newcastle 
- This is the type of traffic which was now possible.

- Nicely exogenous event

- The Limfjord also had a western opening in the Viking age. 
- Ideal hub for viking fleets heading west towards England (Matthiessen 1941; Rasmussen, 1966) 
- Northwestern Denmark in 1100s is very different from ditto in 1800s
- Between 1086 and 1208 the channel closed up (historical + geological sources)

**Data?** 
- Just use register data! 
- Turning dating range + coordinate into panel of economic activity

# Conclusion 
.pull-left[
- **Does first nature influence development beyond eventual path dependence? Yes**
- Storm led to a channel and improved connectivity in 1834
- The population grew 26.7 percent in a generation in affected parishes 
- Intrinsic growth (fertility), fishing and manufacturing
- (Temporal) external validity: Closing of similar channel in 1200 $\rightarrow$ Similar (reverse) effect
