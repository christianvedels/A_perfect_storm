# Introduction
.pull-left[
- Geography is more than soil quality. We are slaves of geomorphology.  
- In 1825 the Agger isthmus* broke by 1834 a natural channel had formed 
- 700 years prior a similar channel had silted up
- Is infrastructure important in economic development? (Fogel, 1964)

#### What will be demonstrated:
  - The channel caused trade 
  - The channel caused a local population boom
  - Mechanism
  - Evidence for the reverse natural experiment in 1100s

- Understanding what causes wealth (wellbeing, etc.) is at the heart of Economics 
- Understanding the interplay between geography (environment) and Economics is vital in the 21st century

# Litterature
.pull-left[
- History desribed by Poulsen (2019, 2022)
- Does infrastructure promote regional development? (Fogel, 1964; Bogart, 2009; Donaldson & Hornbeck, 2016; Berger & Enflo, 2017; etc.)
- Does trade cause growth? (Frankel & Romer, 1999; Feyrer, 2021; Pascali, 2017)
- Fundamental determinants of economic wealth: *Institutions or geography?* 
- Pragmatically: Infrastructure is expensive

**Why this case**: 
- Neat natural experiment: No-one decided that a canal should be constructed

# Timeline

--

#### Pre-event: 
- 1086-1208: Natural western channel closed because of gradual land rises (since the last ice age)
- 1672: Eastern Limfjord town Aalborg 2nd largest in DK 
- Other Limfjord towns lacked far behind under Aalborg's local hedgemony

--

#### Event:
- 1825: Breach of Agger Isthmus
- 1834: Ships start consistently passing through a new natural channel 
- 1841: Independent trade rights to west Limfjord market towns 
- 1850-1900: [Secondary infrastructure and growth](#post-event) 
- 1860-1900: Strong(er) growth

# Empirical strategy

$$log(y_{it}) = Affected_i \times Year_t \beta_t + FE + \varepsilon_{it}$$

*Affected is:*
- The **West** Limfjord, or
- Improved **market access** after the breach

---
![Event](Figures/Map.png)

---
# Market Access
.pull-left[
Based on cost distance from parishes to harbours: 
$${MA}_p = \sum_{h \in H} [CostDist(p, h) + 1]^\theta \times W_{p}$$
- CostDist - Dijkstra's agorithm and 1/10 land/sea ratio 
- $\theta = -1$  
- Breach caused new harbours in West Limfjord: $H\rightarrow H^*$

$$MA_{before} = MA_p|H \\
MA_{after} = MA_p|H^*$$
Main measure:
$$\Delta log(MA) = log(MA_{after})-log(MA_{before})$$

## Mechanism
- **First-order mechanism:** Trade (as documented)
- **Remaining questions**: 

  + *Why was the take-off relatively slow?* 
  + **Answer:** [Institutions and secondary infrastructure](#instmech) had to adapt

  + *What carried the population growth?* 
  + **Answer:** Manufacturing and migration not fishing

# The reverse natural experiment

.pull-left[ 
- The Limfjord also had a western opening in the Viking age. 
- Ideal hub for viking fleets heading west towards England (Matthiessen 1941; Rasmussen, 1966) 
- Northwestern Denmark in 1100s is very different from ditto in 1800s
- Between 1086 and 1208 the channel silted up (Saxo (1208) + geological sources)

**Data?** 
- Just use register data! 
- New method to construct panel sampling $P(Coin|t)_i$ based on Bayes and Monte Carlo

# Conclusion 
.pull-left[
- **RQ:** How are we affected by geography? Does infrastructure cause development?
- Storm led to a channel and improved connectivity in 1834
- The population grew 22 percent in a generation in affected parishes 
- Population growth carried by trade, adaptation and rise of manufacturing

## About the data
- Administrative database of all archaelogical sites and finds 
- Managed by ministry of culture 
- 321 generic types of findings. E.g. coins
- 1940 dated sites with coins between 750 and 1500

- Panel construction:
  + **Innovation:** Monte Carlo to estimate $P_i(Coin|t)$   
  + Probability that a coin finding was generated at a specific time

### The solution
Bayes formula and Monte Carlo!
- Bayes: $P_i(Coin|t) = \frac{P_i(t|Coin)P_i(Coin)}{P_i(t)}$ 
- Monte Carlo: For every coin:
  + Draw random number between $Year_{min}$ and $Year_{max}$ 
  + Repeat 1000 times 
  + Each of these represent a draw from the distribution we are interested in
  + Average to get estimate: $\widehat{P_i}(Coin|t)$
