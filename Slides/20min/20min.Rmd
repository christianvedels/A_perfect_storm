# Introduction
.pull-left[
- Geography is more than soil quality. We are slaves of geomorphology.  
- In 1825 the Agger isthmus* broke by 1834 a natural channel had formed 
- 700 years prior a similar channel had silted up
- Is infrastructure important in economic development? (Fogel, 1964)

#### What will be demonstrated:
  - The channel caused trade 
  - The channel caused a local population boom
  - Mechanism
  - Evidence for the reverse natural experiment in 1100s

# Litterature
.pull-left[
- History desribed by Poulsen (2019, 2022)
- Does infrastructure promote regional development? (Fogel, 1964; Bogart, 2009; Donaldson & Hornbeck, 2016; Berger & Enflo, 2017; etc.)
- Does trade cause growth? (Frankel & Romer, 1999; Feyrer, 2021; Pascali, 2017)
- Fundamental determinants of economic wealth: *Institutions or geography?* 
- Pragmatically: Infrastructure is expensive

**Why this case**: 
- Neat natural experiment: No-one decided that a canal should be constructed

# Timeline

#### Pre-event: 
- 1085-1208: Natural western channel closed because of gradual land rises (since the last ice age)
- 1672: Eastern Limfjord town Aalborg 2nd largest in DK 
- Other Limfjord towns lacked far behind under Aalborg's local hedgemony

--

#### Event:
- 1825: Breach of Agger Isthmus
- 1834: Ships start consistently passing through a new natural channel 
- 1841: Independent trade rights to west Limfjord market towns 
- 1850-1900: [Secondary infrastructure and growth](#post-event) 
- 1860-1900: Strong(er) growth

# Empirical strategy

$$log(y_{it}) = Affected_i \times Year_t \beta_t + FE + \varepsilon_{it}$$

*Affected is:*
- The **West** Limfjord, or
- Improved **market access** after the breach

---
![Event](Figures/Map.png)

# Market Access
.pull-left[
Based on cost distance from parishes to harbours: 
$${MA}_p = \sum_{h \in H} [CostDist(p, h) + 1]^\theta \times W_{p}$$
- CostDist - Dijkstra's agorithm and 1/10 land/sea ratio 
- $\theta = -1$  
- Breach caused new harbours in West Limfjord: $H\rightarrow H^*$

$$MA_{before} = MA_p|H \\
MA_{after} = MA_p|H^*$$
Main measure:
$$\Delta log(MA) = log(MA_{after})-log(MA_{before})$$

# The reverse natural experiment

.pull-left[ 
- The Limfjord also had a western opening in the Viking age. 
- Ideal hub for viking fleets heading west towards England (Matthiessen 1941; Rasmussen, 1966) 
- Northwestern Denmark in 1100s is very different from ditto in 1800s
- Between 1086 and 1208 the channel silted up (Saxo (1208) + geological sources)

**Data?** 
- Just use register data! 
- New method to construct panel sampling $P(Coin|t)_i$ from dating range based on Bayes and Monte Carlo

# Conclusion 
.pull-left[
- **RQ:** How are we affected by geography? Does infrastructure cause development?
- Storm led to a channel and improved connectivity in 1834
- The population grew 22 percent in a generation in affected parishes 
- Population growth carried by trade and adaptation
- Intrinsic growth (fertility), fishing and manufacturing

- Administrative database of all archaelogical sites and finds

- 1940 dated sites with coins between 750 and 1500

- Panel construction:
  + **Innovation:** Monte Carlo to estimate $P_i(Coin|t)$

# Estimator of coin probability
.pull-left[
- **Objective:** We want to know *how likely it is that coin was left at a particular time $t$*
- **What we have:** Observations of individual coin findings and a distribution of times $t$, which are likely for a specific coin finding in a place $i$ 

**In equation form:**
- What we have: $P_i(t|c)$: Probability of $t$ given one coin 
- What we want: $P_i(\{c\}|t)$: Probability of *any* coins in time $t$
]
--
.pull-right[
### The solution
Bayes formula and Monte Carlo
- Simple to sample from this distribution
- Sample $t$ from each coin 
- Count frequency of coin findings
$$P(\{c\}|t)=\left[1-\prod_{c=1}^{K_i} \left( 1 - P(t|c) \right)\right] P(\{c\})$$
where it is assumed that
$P(t|c)\sim \mathscr{U}(Year_{min}^c; Year_{max}^c)$ or
$P(t|c)\sim \mathscr{N}(\mu_c, \sigma_c),$
$\sigma_c=\frac{(Year_{max}^c - Year_{min}^c)}{1.96}$
